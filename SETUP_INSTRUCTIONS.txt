SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
========================

You have created the project structure. Now you need to:

1. Copy all the code files from the artifacts to their respective directories:

   src/types.hpp
   src/order.hpp
   src/events.hpp
   src/orderbook.hpp
   src/replay.hpp
   src/main.cpp
   
   tests/unit_tests.cpp
   tests/property_tests.cpp
   
   benchmarks/perf.cpp
   
   CMakeLists.txt (in root)
   README.md (in root)

2. Build the project:
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make -j$(nproc)

3. Run:
   ./matching_engine_demo

Or use the convenience scripts:
   ./build.sh      # Build everything
   ./run_all.sh    # Run all tests and benchmarks
