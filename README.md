## 📖 Overview

This project implements a **deterministic matching engine** optimized for microsecond-level simulations and backtesting. Unlike generic implementations, it adopts a **Data-Oriented Design (DOD)** approach to minimize instruction cache misses and branch mispredictions.

**Core Philosophy:**
* **Zero Allocation**: No `new`/`malloc` on the hot path. All memory is pre-allocated in contiguous pools.
* **Cache Locality**: Critical data structures are aligned to 64-byte cache lines to prevent false sharing and maximize L1/L2 hits.
* **Determinism**: The engine state is a pure function of the input event stream, allowing for bit-exact replay and debugging.

## ⚡ Performance Benchmarks

Benchmarks were conducted on a consumer workstation (WSL2) under standard load.

- **Environment**:

  Intel Core i9-13980HX (13th Gen)
  WSL2 (Hyper-V)
  GCC 13.3
  `-O3 -march=native`

- **Methodology**: 1,000,000 orders processed in-memory (Hot Path).

| Metric                | Measurement              | Description                                          |
| :-------------------- | :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **Throughput (Mix)**  | **16.4 Million ops/sec** | Realistic Mix (50% Add / 50% Cancel/Trade)           |
| **Throughput (Rest)** | **50.0 Million ops/sec** | Limit Order Placement (Liquidity Building)           |
| **Latency (P50)**     | **30 ns**                | Median processing time per order                     |
| **Latency (P99)**     | **~800 ns**              | Tail latency (subject to OS interrupts/WSL2 noise)   |
| **Cancel Latency**    | **15 ns**                | **O(1)** complexity via Intrusive Doubly-Linked List |

> **Note**: In a bare-metal Linux environment with CPU isolation (isolcpus), tail latency (P99) is expected to be significantly lower (<200ns).

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### 1. Memory Layout (Hot Path)
The engine abandons standard STL containers for the order storage to ensure pointer stability and locality.

* **Object Pool**: Orders are stored in a pre-allocated `std::vector<Order>`. Pointers are stable 64-bit addresses within this block.
* **Intrusive List**: Instead of `std::list` or `std::vector`, orders contain `prev` and `next` pointers. This allows **O(1) removal** from the book without memory deallocation or list traversal.
* **Cache Alignment**:
    ```cpp
    struct Order {
        // ... fields ...
        Order* next;
        Order* prev;
    } __attribute__((aligned(64))); // Fits exactly in one Cache Line
    ```

### 2. Event Sourcing
State mutations are driven strictly by a stream of `Event` variants (`std::variant`).
* **No Virtual Functions**: Polymorphism is handled via `std::visit`, enabling compiler inlining and avoiding vtable lookups.
* **Replay Engine**: The system can reload a CSV log and reconstruct the exact state of the Order Book at any timestamp.

### 3. Type Safety
* **Strong Typing**: `Price`, `Quantity`, and `OrderId` are distinct types (via template wrappers) to prevent semantic errors (e.g., adding a Price to a Quantity).
* **Fixed-Point Arithmetic**: Prices are stored as `int64_t` (scaled by 10,000) to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* C++17 compliant compiler (GCC/Clang/MSVC)
* CMake 3.14+

### Build & Run
The project includes a unified test script that handles build configuration and execution.

```bash
# 1. Build and Run All Tests (Demo + Unit + Benchmarks)
./test.sh

# 2. Run Benchmarks Only
./build/matching_engine_benchmarks

# 3. View Interactive Demo
./build/matching_engine_demo
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Verification of matching logic (FIFO priority, partial fills, multi-level sweeps).
- **Property-Based Tests**: Randomized fuzz testing to verify global invariants:
  - *Non-Crossing*: Best Bid is strictly less than Best Ask.
  - *Conservation*: Executed volume <= Submitted volume.
  - *Idempotence*: `State(Replay(Log)) == State(Original)`.
- **Sanitizers**: Compatible with ASan (AddressSanitizer) and UBSan for memory safety auditing.
